# TODO: Makefile.in
# - detect & set matching OS based on build system
#   (c.f. old GENESIS Makefiles)
# - introduce PLATFORM=`uname -s` to replace MACHINE keyword
#   in all following files;
#   re-use MACHINE=`uname -m` to determine endianness in some
#   cases where `uname -p` isn't working
#
# - confirm TERMCAP & TERMOPTS for other platforms
#   -> create autoconf rule for that
#
# - autoconf provides WORDS_BIGENDIAN via AC_C_BIGENDIAN
#   -> change throughout sprng & in Xodus/Widg/xgifload.c
